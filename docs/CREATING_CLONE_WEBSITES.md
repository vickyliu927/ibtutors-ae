---

## üöÄ Step 1: Create the Clone Document

### 1.1 Access Sanity Studio

1. Navigate to your Sanity Studio (typically `/studio`)
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Look for the **"Website Clones"** section in the navigation

### 1.2 Create New Clone

1. Click **"+ Create"** or **"New Document"**
2. Select **"Clone"** from the document types
3. You'll see the clone creation form

### 1.3 Fill Basic Information

**Clone Name** (Required)
```
Examples:

- "Singapore Education Hub"
```

**Clone Description** (Optional but recommended)
```
Examples:

- **Important**: This ID is used in URLs and queries

---

## üåç Step 2: Configure Domain Settings

### 2.1 Set Region
Choose the appropriate region:
- Middle East
- Asia Pacific  
- Europe
- North America
- Other

### 2.2 Add Target Domains

**Primary Domain** (Required)
```
Examples:
- abudhabitutors.ae
- dubaitutors.com
- ibtutors.co.uk
- singaporetutors.sg
```

**Additional Domains** (Optional)
```
Examples:
- www.abudhabitutors.ae
- tutoring.abudhabi.ae
- abudhabi.ibtutors.ae
```

**Domain Entry Tips:**
- Enter domains without `http://` or `https://`
- One domain per line
- Include both `www` and non-`www` versions if needed
- Ensure domains point to your Next.js application

### 2.3 Set Target Audience

Define who this clone serves:
```
Examples:
- "IB and British curriculum students in Abu Dhabi"
- "GCSE and A-Level students in Dubai"
- "International Baccalaureate students in Singapore"
- "University preparation students in London"
```

---

## üéõÔ∏è Step 3: Clone Settings

### 3.1 Activation Status

**Is Active**: Toggle this to enable/disable the clone
- ‚úÖ **Active**: Clone is live and accessible
- ‚ùå **Inactive**: Clone exists but won't serve content

### 3.2 Baseline Clone

**Important Decision**: Should this be the baseline clone?

**Baseline Clone** = The default fallback for all other clones
- ‚ùå **Most clones**: Leave this unchecked
- ‚úÖ **Only one clone**: Should be marked as baseline
- **Note**: Only ONE clone can be baseline at a time

**When to make a clone baseline:**
- It represents the "default" or most comprehensive content
- Other clones will inherit content from this one
- Usually your main or original website version

---

## üìù Step 4: Save and Verify

### 4.1 Save the Clone

1. Click **"Publish"** to save your clone
2. Verify all fields are correctly filled
3. Check that the clone appears in the clones list

### 4.2 Verify Domain Validation

The system validates domains automatically:
- ‚úÖ **Valid domains**: Green checkmark
- ‚ùå **Invalid domains**: Red error with details
- **Common issues**: 
  - Including `http://` (remove it)
  - Special characters (use only letters, numbers, dots, hyphens)
  - Duplicate domains across clones

---

## üé® Step 5: Create Clone-Specific Content

Now create content specifically for your new clone. You have three approaches:

### 5.1 Clone-Specific Content (Recommended)

Create entirely new content documents that reference your clone:

**Hero Section:**
1. Go to **"Hero Sections"**
2. Create new hero section
3. **Clone Reference**: Select your new clone
4. **Is Active**: Enable
5. Fill in clone-specific content
6. **Clone Specific Data**:
   - Custom title for this clone
   - Custom description
   - Priority and featured settings

**Example for Abu Dhabi Clone:**
```
Title: "Premier IB Tutoring in Abu Dhabi"
Description: "Expert tutors for International Baccalaureate and British curriculum students in Abu Dhabi and surrounding emirates."
Custom Title: "Abu Dhabi's Leading Educational Support"
```

### 5.2 Content Customization

For each content type, you can:

**Testimonials:**
- Add testimonials from local students
- Include location-specific success stories
- Reference local schools and universities

**Tutors:**
- Feature tutors in your region
- Add location preferences
- Include local qualifications

**FAQ Sections:**
- Address region-specific questions
- Include local curriculum information
- Add timezone and availability details

**Platform Banners:**
- Customize messaging for local market
- Include region-specific promotions
- Add local contact information

### 5.3 Inherited Content

Content without clone references will use the fallback hierarchy:
1. **Clone-specific** (your new content)
2. **Baseline clone** (if exists)
3. **Default global** (fallback)

---

## üß™ Step 6: Testing Your Clone

### 6.1 URL Parameter Testing

Test using URL parameters (works immediately):
```
https://yoursite.com?clone=abu-dhabi-tutors
https://yoursite.com/maths?clone=abu-dhabi-tutors
```

### 6.2 Local Domain Testing

For testing actual domains locally:

**1. Update /etc/hosts (Mac/Linux):**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts

# Add these lines:
127.0.0.1 abudhabitutors.local
127.0.0.1 www.abudhabitutors.local
```

**2. Test locally:**
```
http://abudhabitutors.local:3000
```

**3. Check middleware headers in browser dev tools:**
- Look for `x-clone-id: abu-dhabi-tutors`
- Verify `x-clone-name: Abu Dhabi Tutors`

### 6.3 Debug Information

Enable debug mode to see:
- Which clone is active
- Content source for each section
- Fallback hierarchy in action
- Domain mapping status

**In Development:**
- Add `?debug=true` to any URL
- Check browser console for detailed logs
- Use the CloneIndicatorBanner component

---

## üöÄ Step 7: Production Deployment

### 7.1 DNS Configuration

Point your domains to your hosting platform:

**Vercel Example:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Add domain to your project
3. Configure DNS records:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: abudhabitutors.ae
   Value: your-project.vercel.app
   ```

**Other Platforms:**
- Follow your hosting provider's domain setup guide
- Ensure domains point to the same Next.js application

### 7.2 SSL/HTTPS Setup

Most hosting platforms handle SSL automatically:
- Vercel: Automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
- Netlify: Automatic SSL
- Custom hosting: Configure SSL certificates

### 7.3 Verification

Once DNS propagates (can take 24-48 hours):
1. Visit your new domain
2. Verify clone-specific content appears
3. Check that fallback content works
4. Test all major pages and functionality

---

## üéØ Step 8: Content Strategy Planning

### 8.1 Content Priority Matrix

**High Priority (Create First):**
- Hero section (main landing experience)
- Contact information (local details)
- Tutor profiles (regional tutors)
- Key testimonials (local success stories)

**Medium Priority:**
- FAQ sections (region-specific questions)
- Platform banners (local promotions)
- Highlights sections (local benefits)

**Low Priority (Can inherit):**
- Footer content (unless legal differences)
- General educational content
- Basic site structure

### 8.2 Localization Considerations

**Language:**
- Adapt language for local audience
- Use local terminology and spellings
- Consider cultural nuances

**Curriculum:**
- Highlight relevant curriculum (IB, British, American, local)
- Mention specific exam boards
- Include grade level equivalents

**Practical Details:**
- Local contact numbers and addresses
- Timezone information
- Currency (if applicable)
- Local holidays and school calendars
