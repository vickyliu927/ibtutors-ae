# Component Cleanup - Duplicate Removal

## Overview

Cleaned up the homepage by removing duplicated components that were causing visual redundancy and layout issues.

## Components Removed

### **1. AdvertBlock Component**
- **File**: `app/components/AdvertBlock.tsx` (component file remains for potential future use)
- **Usage**: Removed from homepage after SubjectGrid section
- **Reason**: Was appearing twice on the page (blue and orange versions)
- **Impact**: Eliminates duplicate promotional content

### **2. InteractiveTutoringPlatform Component**
- **File**: `app/components/InteractiveTutoringPlatform.tsx` (component file remains)
- **Usage**: Removed from homepage between SubjectGrid and TutoringPlatformBanner
- **Reason**: Was duplicating content with the later ONLINE TUTORING PLATFORM section
- **Impact**: Removes redundant platform showcase content

## Technical Changes Made

### **Homepage Structure Updates**
```tsx
// REMOVED from app/page.tsx:
{/* Advert Block - Positioned after SubjectGrid section */}
{advertBlockSection?.enabled !== false ? (
  <AdvertBlock sectionData={advertBlockSection} />
) : null}

<InteractiveTutoringPlatform />
```

### **Import Cleanup**
```tsx
// REMOVED imports:
import AdvertBlock from "./components/AdvertBlock";
import InteractiveTutoringPlatform from "./components/InteractiveTutoringPlatform";
```

### **Data Pipeline Cleanup**
```tsx
// REMOVED from HomepageData interface:
advertBlockSection: any | null;

// REMOVED from data fetching and processing:
- advertBlockSection variable assignment
- advertBlockSection in return objects
- advertBlockSection in destructuring assignments
```

### **Clone Queries Cleanup**
```tsx
// REMOVED from app/lib/cloneQueries.ts:
- advertBlockSection from return type interface
- advertBlockSection from parallel Promise.all array
- advertBlockSection from return object
```

## Current Homepage Flow

### **After Cleanup**
1. **Navbar**
2. **HeroSection** 
3. **HighlightsSection**
4. **TutorProfiles**
5. **TrustedInstitutionsBanner**
6. **SubjectGrid** (5% enlarged)
7. **TutoringPlatformBanner** (remaining platform content)
8. **TestimonialSection**
9. **FAQSection**
10. **ContactForm**
11. **Footer**

### **Visual Result**
- **No Duplication**: Each section appears only once
- **Clean Flow**: Logical progression from content to content
- **Reduced Redundancy**: No repetitive promotional messages
- **Improved UX**: Cleaner, more focused user experience
